        ### Parameters:
        --------------
            - `function (Callable)`: The function to be executed for each item in the data source.
            - `data_source (Iterable)`: An iterable containing the data to be processed by the specified function.
            - `progress_bar (bool, optional)`: If True, a progress bar will be displayed. Default is True.
            - `*args` | `**kwargs`: Additional arguments to pass to the specified function.

        ### Returns:
        --------------
            - `Generator` that yields results from the specified function executions.

        ### Notes:
        ------------
            - If progress_bar is True and data_source is not a list or tuple, it will be converted to a list.
            - The execution of tasks is done concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor.
            - Results are yielded as they are completed.
            - Exceptions encountered during task execution are caught and printed.
